Anyway, I can tell that you're rearing to begin, so I'll spare you the rest of the details.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Navigate to one of the exercises (listed below)</li>
    <li><code>clone</code> and <code>cd</code> to the exercise repo, if you haven't done so already</li>
    <li>Run the contained <code>go</code> script by executing <code>./go</code>.
      <br>
      This sets up the required Git hooks, resets the repo, and starts the exercise.
    </li>
    <li>Follow the instructions that appear in your browser and terminal</li>
  </ol>
  If you ever get yourself into too much trouble or want to restart the exercise, just run the <code>go</code> script and everything will be reset, fresh and ready to go!
</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
